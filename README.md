Phishing is a cyber-attack where attackers attempt to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, or personal data. This is often done through deceptive emails, messages, or websites that appear legitimate but are fraudulent.

A phishing link scanner is a cybersecurity tool that helps detect and analyze suspicious URLs to determine whether they lead to phishing or malicious websites.

How It Works
Fetches the latest phishing links from OpenPhish.
Extracts the domain from the input URL.
Check if the domain exists in the phishing database.
Uses regex to detect suspicious patterns.
Prints whether the URL is safe or a potential phishing attempt.

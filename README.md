Phishing is a cyber-attack where attackers attempt to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, or personal data. This is often done through deceptive emails, messages, or websites that appear legitimate but are fraudulent.

A phishing link scanner is a cybersecurity tool that helps detect and analyze suspicious URLs to determine whether they lead to phishing or malicious websites.
